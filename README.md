# Math Booster - Class Implementations

## Language Choice
**Python** was chosen for its readability, dynamic typing, rich libraries, and strong community support for educational tools and rapid prototyping.

## Design Decisions
- All classes from the UML diagram are modeled using private attributes with appropriate methods.
- Inheritance is used for `Learner` and `Educator` from the `User` base class.
- UUIDs are used for unique identifiers.
- Composition and method stubs reflect real behavior to be implemented later.
- Separation of class responsibilities is preserved to align with SOLID principles.
