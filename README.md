### Programming language choice and key decisions

####  Why Python?

Python was chosen for its:

- **Simplicity & Readability** – Easy translation from UML to code with minimal syntax overhead.  
- **Rapid Prototyping** – Ideal for fast development and iteration on design patterns.  
- **Strong Testing Support** – Tools like `pytest` and `pytest-cov` enable clean, efficient testing and coverage reporting.  
- **Community & Ecosystem** – Wide support for CI/CD, design pattern demos, and educational use cases.

####  Key Design Choices

- **Clear Pattern Separation** – Each creational pattern is isolated in its own module.  
- **UML Alignment** – Classes directly reflect the Mermaid class diagram.  
- **CI-Ready** – Includes GitHub Actions + Codecov integration for automated testing and reporting.
